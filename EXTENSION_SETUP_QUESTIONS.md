I can read and access the files you listed that you've added to the chat. I see and can edit these files now:
- background.js
- content.js
- manifest.json
- menu.html
- menu.js
- popout.html
- popout.js
- readme.md
- style.css
- EXTENSION_SETUP_QUESTIONS.md

Note: you only pasted the contents of EXTENSION_SETUP_QUESTIONS.md; for the other files I will trust your statement that they are present in the chat and use the contents you provided when I make edits. I cannot read files that were not added to the chat.

Would you like me to proceed with the round of clarifying questions listed in the file, or do you prefer I use the default choices (Chrome, MV3, chrome.storage.local, detect .check-portion/fieldset, add .gitignore with node_modules/, dist/, .DS_Store, *.log)? Please answer or say "Go ahead â€” use defaults" and I'll prepare the changes.
